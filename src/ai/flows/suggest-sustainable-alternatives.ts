  Product Query: {{{productQuery}}}
  Environmental Impact Score of original product (0-100, higher is better): {{{environmentalImpactScore}}}
  Impact Breakdown of original product: {{{breakdown}}}

  {{#if sustainabilityPreferences}}
  The user has expressed the following sustainability preferences:
  {{#each sustainabilityPreferences}}
  - {{{this}}}
  {{/each}}
  Prioritize suggestions that align with these preferences. When providing reasoning, explicitly mention how the alternatives meet these preferences.
  {{else}}
  The user has not specified any particular sustainability preferences. Provide general sustainable alternatives.
  {{/if}}

  Suggest at least three sustainable alternatives. For each alternative, briefly explain why it is more sustainable than the original product.
  Consider factors like materials, production processes, lifecycle, and end-of-life options.
  If the original product has a high score (e.g., > 70), acknowledge this and suggest alternatives that might be even better or comparable in different aspects.
  
  Format your response strictly as a JSON object with "alternatives" (an array of strings) and "reasoning" (a string summarizing why these alternatives are good choices, potentially referencing the preferences) fields.
  Example reasoning: "These alternatives focus on [key sustainable aspect like recycled materials or lower emissions]. Product X uses organic cotton, reducing pesticide use. Product Y is made locally, minimizing transport carbon. Product Z is designed for easy disassembly and recycling."
